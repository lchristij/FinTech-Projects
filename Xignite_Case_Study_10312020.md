# The Xignite Enterprise Solution Case Study
<div style="text-align: justify">FinTech. A word that has been weaving its way into the fabric of economies around the world for almost fifty years, but what is it exactly? Why is it so important now? Where did it originate from? Why do we need it? And what impact is it having on the economy? According to a New York Times article, the term FinTech is said to have been around since 1971 however, it was coined at the Financial Services Technology Consortium established by Citicorp in 1993 and refers to the development of online digital technologies in the financial services industry.  For several years, the industry has been ripe for entrepreneurs seeking new ways to reduce operational cost, increase efficiency and stimulate economic growth, all of which has led to disruptive innovation across all sectors of the industry. The rapid, pervasive pace of innovation has paved the way for services such as mobile banking which allows consumers to deposit checks, transfer funds, issue payments and make withdraws without ever making a trip to the bank. Purchasing real estate and other financial assets like stocks, options, bonds and even digital currencies with the assistance of robo advisors and algorithms can now be done from the palm of your hand.  In this case study I will focus on the competitive landscape of enterprise solutions for wealth and investment management services and a company front and center of the next FinTech revolution wave in market data enterprise solutions.</div>

To remain competitive, corporations centered around wealth and investment management services must have reliable access to high quality, real-time, delayed and historical market data.  Xignite is one such global provider of centralized, highly scalable, cloud-based APIs offering access to a breadth of in-depth Level II market data, utilized for building rich B2C services as well as research and analysis. According to the company’s website, Xignite was founded in 2000 by  Stephane Dubois, its original intent was to offer a wealth management platform however, when Stephane discovered that procuring the market data needed to power his platform from large legacy vendors restricting access, would be too arduous a task, he decided to pivot and partner with innovators in the industry such as EURONEXT, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and CoppClark to name a few, and created his own market data APIs.  The idea soon caught the attention of other firms facing similar market data delivery and integration challenges thus leading Stephane to create Xignite. As the company acquired more clients and added new capabilities to their product line, investors also began taking notice of Xignite’s growth and as a result the company has attracted more than $35M in investment capital, according to researchers crunchbase and owler.com. Xignite positioned itself as a leading provider of low-cost, high-quality market data by utilizing advanced programing languages such as VB .NET, ASP .NET, C#, JAVA, Perl, PHP, Ruby and recently Python, to offer datasets in multiple flavors (i.e., Excel, CSV, etc.) across cloud-based REST APIs in Amazon’s AWS environment, giving the company a unique competitive advantage.  By its own admission, the company’s solution addresses the age-old problem of managing multiple sources of fragmented, monolithic data from legacy systems. Xignite excels at this so well that other FinTech companies such as Betterment, SoFi, Etoro and BlackRock trust them to provide some of their most mission critical market data. Xignite reports that it has over 800 clients in their circle of trust and thus plenty of room to grow in the $32B market data solutions business as reported by Business Insider and Traders Magazine. Therefore, as more companies seek to lower their data acquisition cost, reduce operational risk and centralize data flows across a common architecture, Xignite stands a good chance of capturing additional market share.

## A BREIF OF THE MARKET DATA SOLUTIONS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
As one might imagine, technological disruption in a $32B market is bound to attract competition thereby increasing the speed of innovation.  Driving this innovation is the demand for market data which has been steadily increasing over the past 20yrs forcing providers to transition from legacy architectures (see figure 1.0) to more flexible and highly scalable microservice frameworks (see figure 2.0) in order to stay ahead of demand while also offering new capabilities. Those slow to transition are leaving market share opportunities on the table for new participants like Xignite and its competitors, some of which are Intrino, Barchart and ACTIV Financial according to owler.com and datarade.ai, each uniquely differentiating itself across the landscape.  For example, FinTech competitor Intrinio founded in 2012, offers three main products: (1) Artificial Intelligence (AI) based fundamentals for US public companies, (2) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings that can be integrated into algorithms and (3) reliable, flexible, fast, real-time, delayed, intraday and historical Level I market data for US stocks, ETFs, options and cryptocurrencies in multiple formats (i.e., Excel, CSV, etc.) using Ruby, R, Java, C# and Python across REST APIs. While Intrinio’s financials, customer base and data delivery metrics are not well defined, owler.com reports the company revenues between $100K-$5M. Another example is Barchart.com founded in 1995, is one of the most seasoned competitors among the group offering primarily Level I real-time, delayed and historical market data for equities, futures and commodities from within an Angular, React and VueJS frameworks utilizing HTML5 compliant libraries written in JavaScript. According to Barchart.com they have more than 70 clients however while owler.com reports the company revenues between $5M-25M, the company’s financials and data delivery metrics are not well defined. Lastly, competitor ACTIV Financial founded in 2002 is a global FinTech firm providing Level I and II market data solutions that cover 150 fixed income, equities and derivatives exchanges around the world over a managed direct access platform that eliminates the need to host compute resources, write and manage APIs. ACTIV Financial has over 300 customers and revenues of $33M however data delivery metrics are not well defined. Exante Data deserves honorable mention as one of the few FinTech companies offering comprehensive FX focused data solutions comprised of central bank, global and emerging market data flow analytics with no less than twenty thousand time series data points (see attached video interview w/CEO).

These are just a few of Xignite’s competitors and while each is exceling with varying degrees of success Xignite’s competitive edge resides in its ability to enter the market early, build out enterprise level microservices and deliver market data over a wide range of technologies (i.e., AWS cloud, Java, C#, VB & ASP .NET, Ruby, Perl, PHP and Python) supporting more than 250 different data sources and 12 billion API calls per day. However, Xignite’s patented CloudAlerts REST API technology which allows clients to provide their customers real-time, customizable market data driven user alerts at scale, is the most notable competitive advantage. Further, the company has been named to WealthTech 100 list of the world’s most innovative technology solution provider to asset managers, private banks and financial advisors 2yrs in a row and with revenues between $25M-100M as reported by owler.com, the company is poised to be a formidable leader in the Fintech enterprise solution domain. 


## STRATEGIC ADVISORY SUMMARY
While Xignite is quickly establishing itself as the premiere enterprise market data solutions provider, there are a couple of key markets such as managed services and Artificial Intelligence that have great potential to significantly increase the company’s market share and boost revenue. Managed market data services is one area where its competitor ACTIV Financial, excels because many B2C financial companies are unwilling or incapable of pivoting to new technologies and would rather have their solution managed. Xignite could leverage its knowledge base to develop and manage pre-packaged modules using languages currently supported for making REST API calls to in-house data. Partnerships with telecom and hardware vendors should be established to deploy dedicated Virtual Private Network (VPN) circuits and proxy servers and AWS should be utilized to allocate compute resources to client sites.  AI technologies such as Deep Learning can add another layer of intelligence by using market data to create next-level valuation reports that can be utilized to provide on-demand robo advisor services in addition, Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules should be developed to offer voice enable account management services.  These new capabilities could be packaged and added to the company’s current suite of microservices and marketed to B2C investment and wealth management companies.
